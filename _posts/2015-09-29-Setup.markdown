title: Setup
---

To have the self contained and easy to setup lab environment, I have created the Vagrant Box and setup labs around that. Each lab is consist of some theory, instructions and recording of the terminal, while running those instructions.  

## Requirement 

- Download and setup [VirtualBox **5.0**](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

- Download and setup [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

- Get the Vagrant file

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nkhare/data_and_network_containers/gh-pages/Vagrantfile
```

- Start the VMS

```
$ vagrant up
```

By detault Vagrant would start 2 VMs, as we need them in few labs. If you just want to start one
VM, please set **NUM_LABVMS** environment variable to 1

```
export NUM_LABVMS=1
```

- Check the status of VMS *vagrant status*

```
$ vagrant status
Current machine states:

labvm-1                   running (virtualbox)
labvm-2                   running (virtualbox)
```
